# No Bin Snacks

This start-up was founded by Giovanni, Marthe and Franziska with the aim to fight food waste. Our main goal for the future? Being more sustainable, ecological and smarter than the regular trade!

We save second quality, dented, wilted or dried foods from the bin, and prepare delicious and healthy snacks. We collaborate with local farmers, food markets, grocery stores and restaurants.

Our product range depends on available food waste. For that reason are our prices also not set in stone. That's why we regularly adjust them and communicate these changes - transparently and understandably.
